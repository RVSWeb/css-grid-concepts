                    Cabernet Franc is one of the major black grape varieties worldwide. It is principally grown for
                    blending with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in the Bordeaux style, but can also be vinified alone,
                    as in the Loire's Chinon.

                    Semillon is a golden-skinned grape used to make dry and sweet white wines, mostly in France and
                    Australia. Its thin skin and susceptibility to botrytis make it dominate the sweet wine region

                    Sauvignon Blanc is a green-skinned grape variety that originates from the Bordeaux region of France.
                    The grape most likely gets its name from the French words sauvage and blanc due to its early origins
                    as an indigenous grape in South West France.
